# 👋 Hello, I'm Morgan

🎮 I'm a game development student currently specializing in Unreal Engine.  
I'm especially focused on gameplay systems, and I've been working a lot with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS), both in Blueprint and C++.

I'm passionate about building flexible, modular gameplay architectures and experimenting with networked features in Unreal Engine.
